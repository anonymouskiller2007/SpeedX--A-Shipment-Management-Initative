# SpeedX--A-Shipment-Management-Initative
Hello Everyone. 
Here we a group of three have created what we would like to call "SpeedX". 
Its a shipment management software open sourced and free of cost for anyone to use.
It's based on mysql connectivity as well as python 3.x .Feel free to use it. 
Just make sure to install **colorama**    **pyfiglet**   and   **tabulate**   in order for the program to work.
